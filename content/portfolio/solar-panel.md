The goal was to develop and deploy a classification model that could accurately identify the presence of solar panels with precision and efficiency.

To accomplish this, I chose to leverage the VGGNet architecture, a renowned deep learning model known for its exceptional performance in image recognition tasks. To perform a comparative analysis, I also implemented Logistic and KNN model. To ensure robustness of the models, I maintained a rigorous and iterative approach by fine-tuning the model architectures, optimizing hyperparameters and using validation sets.
