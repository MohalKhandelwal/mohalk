The purpose of this project is to identify “What variables contribute to post-harvest losses for farmers across Africa?”. Affognon et al (2015) conducted a meta-analysis of literature examining a similar research question for the region of sub-Saharan Africa. They found that economic losses from post-harvest loss outweighs physical losses for most farmers. The analysis in thr report takes a slightly different approach and uses a larger survey dataset containing information from over 9,500 farmers from 13 countries across Africa rather than data pulled from the literature. Understanding the extent of post-harvest losses on smallholder farms and important variables that may determine post-harvest loss is important to improving productivity and therefore, food security.

As part of the analysis, I developed an intuitive and informative dashboard that served as a visual representation of the findings. Leveraging the power of libraries such as Matplotlib and Pyplot, we created over 20 exploratory data analysis (EDA) plots that effectively showcased the affected demographics and highlighted significant trends and patterns.
